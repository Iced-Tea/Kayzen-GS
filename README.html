<h2 id="why-use-inline-block-for-columns-">Why use inline-block for columns?</h2>
<p>The simple answer is; flexibility. By definition, columns <em>are</em> just inline blocks - it&#39;s the way CSS columns are supposed to work. Using the native CSS columns by applying <strong>inline-block</strong> opens up a whole world of flexibility for your columns - the most useful benefit being the ability to set their horizontal and vertical align, just by setting the <em>text-align</em> and <em>vertical-align</em> properties respectively. </p>

<h2 id="why-don-t-other-grid-systems-use-inline-block-">Why don&#39;t other grid systems use inline-block?</h2>
<p>By default, using <strong>inline-block</strong> for columns causes a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/">natural whitespace</a> to appear between each column, which can vary in width from font to font and browser to browser. Indeed, this has caused <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=inline-block+column">many people many problems</a>, and there are plenty of go-to <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/remove-whitespace-inline-block">hacky and impractical</a> work arounds, none of which are really suitble for a production environment. However, for the first time Kayzen GS allows for the use of completely usable and functional columns which use <strong>inline-block</strong> and have <strong>no white-space</strong>. And to top it all off, it works on all browsers, including <strong>Internet Explorer 6</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="what-about-flex-">What about Flex?</h2>
<p>Go ahead and use Flex instead of this if you want, seriously. I&#39;m a firm believer of improving web standards, so completely undersyand why anyone would prefer to use Flex.</p>
